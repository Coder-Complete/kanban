backend project

kanban
- this is a good project for practicing backend before getting into auth
- this design is pretty simple for a scrum app and ignores a lot of features that jira has

data tables
- boards
- columns in boards
- tasks (belong to boards i suppose)
    - title
    - description
    - subtasks
    - status


my additions
- things jira has that the design doesnâ€™t
- epics and stories?
- projected timelines based on estimates of all the tickets belonging to a story?
- comments on tickets
- 

considerations
- for subtasks - will have to search all tasks under that board, so will need db that supports text search
