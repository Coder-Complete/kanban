backend project

kanban
- this is a good project for practicing backend before getting into auth
- this design is pretty simple for a scrum app and ignores a lot of features that jira has

data tables
- boards
- columns in boards
- tasks (belong to boards i suppose)
    - title
    - description
    - subtasks
    - status


my additions
- things jira has that the design doesnâ€™t
- epics and stories?
- projected timelines based on estimates of all the tickets belonging to a story?
- comments on tickets
- 

considerations
- for subtasks - will have to search all tasks under that board, so will need db that supports text search


steps
0. x - set up react app w/ vite
1. set up vanilla node.js server

2. connect backend to frontend

  - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/3-things-to-consider-before-deploying-your-first-full-stack-app/
  - local is simple: frontend is deployed at port 3000, backend at 5000, frontend requests from 127.0.0.1:5000
3. nodemon
4. build a backend until raw js gets ugly
5. rewrite w/ express (benefits - easy org, plugin libraries)
6. deploy and backend is connected to frontend in deployed version
7. set up db and connect to backend (locally and deployed)
9. define & implement db schemas
9. build the routes
